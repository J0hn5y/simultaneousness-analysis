# simultaneousness analysis
This Project aims to determine simultaneousness factors for the use in power grid calculations. There for times series of solar radiation and wind velocity (air temperature,...) with the focus from the north of Germany are evaluated. 
The collaborative use of python and a data base like SQLite is part of the objective as well.
Frist Idea for datasets with a good temporal resolution (10 minutes): https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/10_minutes/
